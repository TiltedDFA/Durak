The card to drop down box now works, although it doesn't use the overlap function checker, it currently just checks if the card is touching the hit box. 
TO DO:
-Fix the hit box percentage checker function
-Make the defending cards placeable atop of the attacking cards on table with a suitable offset such that the card below is visible
-Make the card pointer vector work so that multiple cards from any source can be  placed on the table as currently, the only cards being displayed are the table cards
-Change program to work around the card pointing vector (not looking forward to this)
-Make a deck appear
-Only display cards in the players hands initally
-Make the cards
-Make the 'beaten' pile
-Make rounds
-Make game logic
-Make win conditions
-Design the opening screen
-Make an AI for the opponent of the player

Fixed the box percentage checking function. The annoying thing that still hasn't been solved is the updating system. Will need to also rewrite a lot of code to impliment the 
pointers card system
Updated TO DO list : 
-Change the update system
-Make the defending cards placeable atop of the attacking cards on table with a suitable offset such that the card below is visible
-Make the card pointer vector work so that multiple cards from any source can be  placed on the table as currently, the only cards being displayed are the table cards
-Change program to work around the card pointing vector (not looking forward to this)
-Make a deck appear
-Only display cards in the players hands initally
-Make the cards

Realised that I don't need to actually use pointers for the cards in play vector, It will be a normal card array. It will copy a card into the vector and do the calculations based on that.
// Update, realised that wouldn't work as updating the information for the cards in the cards in play array wouldn't actually update the cards.
Contemplating the system. As I would need a system to transfer the cards from hand to table to other piles seemlessly, there's no easy way of doing that. Also need to make a deck appear. Will 
likely have the cards automatically added to the player's hand after the start of a turn. Questions such as how to graphically move the cards from deck to hand and how to display the hand with less
cards pops to mind. Need to learn more about pointers to make the pointer system work or will need to think of another way to do this.

As for how to do the card placement offset, could do a turn based system where the attacking cards will spawn at a certain place while the deffending cards will spawn with an offset.
From this have thought to potentially display cards based on where they're stored. E.g. if a card is in player hand then it's spawn will be controlled by a player hand function. 
as for the table, the card will spawn based on the index of the table so to integrate the display system with the system that controlls how the table will be played.

Have been told after asking in a C++ discord server that my pointer thing should work so will give it a try.

I think the card pointer system is now working for the table cards, Now I need to make it work with the cards in hand, top card of deck and need to integrate it into the displaying system
side note: Don't forget to test the specific card deletion function for the ptr vector

Just tested the card pointer removing system and it seems to work as intended just remember to *get the pointer from the class the card is in*
Will now work to integrate the new card pointing system to the display systems. Preparing for a long night of debugging.

BY SOME MIRICLE MY NEW POINTER SYSTEM WORKS FIRST TRY WITHOUT ANY ISSUES, I AM SO HAPPY!!
will now work on changing the fact that currently the cards are being displayed from the table and will work on them being displayed from player hand
->20:35 
have run into a lot of issue when switching out the player hand for the table. Seems there's some deconstruction issues
->20:50 
Have been recommended to switch to smart pointers in order to allocate to the heap, so will research and try to adapt to that.
->21:26
After realising that if i were to use smart pointers, I'd need to practically rewrite my program I decided to instead change what is causing the cards to deconstruct, which is the Player Hand vector. It is now an array of size 20 since
it'd be had for someone to realistically have more cards in their hand at once, might make it 30 to be certain that no one could possible have more cards in hand.
Next focus should be working on the updating loop to make the placement of cards and checking of hitboxing seemless so will need to rework the one cards at a time design
->21:32 
the update system was an easy fix, commented out the condition of running the checks based on mouse buttons. SHOULDN'T affect anything thought it was commented out instead of deleted for the time being to ensure there's no issues cause 
by it
-> Add something that indicated a proper fix

Have worked on the table design to accomdate for the deck and for the 'beeta' pile in photoshop, Will work today on coding that into it once i've finished designing it. 
While on the bus, will add reversed card to deck function.
->15:30 
While writing a few functions for the deck, I have realised that displaying the deck will have to be another system from current displaying system due to the fac of how i need to display cards.
->20:30
Have recentlt implimented a 'canBeTouched' system for the cards so the player cannot interact with cards in the other player's hand nor can they interact with cards in the beaten pile
Will need to work on the graphics to add buttons that end turn among other stuff and will also need too add graphics to where the players cards are that differenciate them from the table.
->20:58 
Have made a basic table display system work. It will need to have the deck pile resized in the image and for the deck to represent cards
End for today

Planning to breifly slap in a system that actually seperates the next 2 cards from deck and gives them their correct starting positions.
->13:54
Working on a making the deck display system work from the actual cards.
->14:36
Fixed some issues surrounding the deck displaying system and also added a card pile for the discarded cards. I will now work on game calculations and functionalily aswell as rounds.

Game management system ideas : The main loop will control the things that interact with the game functions which will be written in a different file.
There will need to be a file or a seperate thing that will take the user inputs and convert them into something the program will process. This will be
a priority for another time. Currently will focus on a rounds system.
