The card to drop down box now works, although it doesn't use the overlap function checker, it currently just checks if the card is touching the hit box. 
TO DO:
-Fix the hit box percentage checker function
-Make the defending cards placeable atop of the attacking cards on table with a suitable offset such that the card below is visible
-Make the card pointer vector work so that multiple cards from any source can be  placed on the table as currently, the only cards being displayed are the table cards
-Change program to work around the card pointing vector (not looking forward to this)
-Make a deck appear
-Only display cards in the players hands initally
-Make the cards
-Make the 'beaten' pile
-Make rounds
-Make game logic
-Make win conditions
-Design the opening screen
-Make an AI for the opponent of the player
